are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**\n \n- 🗺️ **Explore**: Generate a correlation matrix between the numeric columns. What columns are positively and negatively correlated with each other? Does it change if you segment it by the purpose of the loan?\n- 📊 **Visualize**: Plot histograms for every numeric column with a color element to segment the bars by `not_fully_paid`.\n- 🔎 **Analyze**: Do loans with the same purpose have similar qualities not shared by loans with differing purposes? You can consider only fully paid loans.\n\n**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**\n\nYou recently got a job as a machine learning scientist at a startup that wants to automate loan approvals. As your first project, your manager would like you to build a classifier to predict whether a loan will be paid back based on this data. There are two things to note. First, there is class imbalance; there are fewer examples of loans not fully paid. Second, it's more important to accurately predict whether a loan will not be paid back rather than if a loan is paid back. Your manager will want to know how you accounted for this in training and evaluation your model.\n\nYou will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your motivation, analysis steps, findings, and conclusions.","metadata":{},"id":"0da7abf5","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.12","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
